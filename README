* Why configure does not detect CFSQP?

CFSQP is always distributed as a C header and source file.  As a result, you
will have to build yourself a library to use CFSQP with roboptim.

Copy cfsqp.c qld.c and cfsqpusr.h in a directory and type:
$ g++ cfsqp.c qld.c -shared -fPIC -o libcfsqp.so

Then, make sure that gcc search for headers/libraries in this directory. For
instance, you can call configure with additional parameters:

$ cd roboptim-core
$ mkdir _build && cd _build
$ ../configure CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/cfsqp LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/cfsqp


* Where is the library documentation?

This README only covers configure/building issues, for more information
regarding this library usage, please refer to the Doxygen documentation.

If you have configured the package as explained in the first section, go
into you ``_build'' directory and type:

$ make doc

To view the HTML documentation: go in the ``doc/html'' directory and open the
``index.html'' file with your favorite internet browser.


* How to use Valgrind with the test suite?

All the tests launched by the test suite can be prefixed
with the environment variable ``CHECK_PREFIX''.

$ export CHECK_PREFIX='valgrind --log-file=valgrind.log'
$ make check
