Error : Step size has been smaller than the computed
machine precision !!


Error: No feasible point is found for nonlinear inequality
constraints and linear equality constraints
Problem:
  Twice derivable function
  Argument's bounds: (1, 5), (1, 5), (1, 5), (1, 5)
  Argument's scales: 1, 1, 1, 1
  Number of constraints: 2
  Starting point: [4](1,5,5,1)
  Infinity value (for all functions): inf
A solution should have been found. Failing...
Infeasible guess for linear and non-linear constraints.
