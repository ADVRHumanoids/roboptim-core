Solver:
  Plugin: dummy-td
  Problem:
    x₀ * x₃ * (x₀ + x₁ + x₂) + x₃ (twice differentiable function)
    Argument's bounds: (1, 5), (1, 5), (1, 5), (1, 5)
    Argument's scales: 1, 1, 1, 1
    Number of constraints: 2
    Constraint 0
        x₀ * x₁ * x₂ * x₃ (twice differentiable function)
        Bounds: (25, inf)
        Scales: 1
    Constraint 1
        x₀² + x₁² + x₂² + x₃² (twice differentiable function)
        Bounds: (40, 40)
        Scales: 1
    No starting point.
    Infinity value (for all functions): inf
  Result:
    Solver error: The dummy solver always fail.
  Parameters:
    dummy-parameter (dummy parameter): 42
    dummy-parameter2 (yet another dummy parameter): 3
    dummy-parameter3 (just a dummy key): ...and a dummy value!

A solution has not been found. As expected...
The dummy solver always fail.
