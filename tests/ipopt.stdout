NOTE: You are using Ipopt by default with the MUMPS linear solver.
      Other linear solvers might be more efficient (see Ipopt documentation).


This is Ipopt version 3.5.5, running with linear solver mumps.

All variables are fixed and constraint violation 0.000000e+00
   is below tolerance 1.000000e-08. Declaring success.

EXIT: Optimal Solution Found.
