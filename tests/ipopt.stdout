Problem:
  Twice derivable function
  Argument's bounds: (1, 5), (1, 5), (1, 5), (1, 5)
  Argument's scales: 1, 1, 1, 1
  Number of constraints: 2
  Constraint 0
      Bounds: (25, inf)
      Scales: 1
      
  Constraint 1
      Bounds: (40, 40)
      Scales: 1
      
  Starting point: [4](1,5,5,1)
  Infinity value (for all functions): inf
A solution has been found: 
[4](1,4.743,3.82115,1.37941)
f(*x) = 14.5723
