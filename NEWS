* [MAJOR ABI BREAKING CHANGE] Add Eigen::Ref support: now RobOptim functions
  accept blocks/segments of Eigen matrices as input.
* Lots of new functions (cos, sin, etc.), operators (plus, minus, scalar, map
  etc.) and decorators (cached function etc.).
* Callback system (logger, callback multiplexer).
* Simple Matplotlib support for visualization.
* Function pools.
* Set argument names (useful for plotting).
* Improved CachedFunction with LRU cache.
* Automatic conversion of constraints/cost function types when creating
  problems.
* Faster forward-difference rule for finite differences.
* Removed exception specifiers (void function(...) throw()).
* Storage order was changed from Eigen's default (column-major) to row-major.
  The storage order is available in the GenericFunctionTraits (StorageOrder).
* Move metaprogramming magic to roboptim/core/detail/utility.hh.
* Merge roboptim/core/visualization/util.hh with roboptim/core/util.hh.
