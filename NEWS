* ColMajor/RowMajor support has been improved (cf. #89). Default is back to
  ColMajor since this is Eigen's default mode, but that can be changed with a
  CMake variable.
* Allocation checking has been improved (cf. #92).
* Multiplots are now available with the matplotlib plotting backend (cf. #94).
* Added vector_t and bool to the solver parameter types. As a consequence,
  std::string parameters should not rely on automatic conversion from const
  char* (cf. 7a0bbb74c60dd21a9f467a20fe02df67c2dd689f). Basically:

  // This will be converted to bool:
  parameters["key"].value = "value";
  // While this will be a string:
  parameters["key"].value = std::string ("value");

* Renamed scale[s]* to scaling* (cf. 434559c940f0866724c24bc32921ee8adfcb005f).
  Previous methods/typedefs are currently kept for backward compatibility, but
  marked as deprecated.
* Add new StructuredInput helper (cf. #96).
* Add support for matrix plotting with matplotlib (cf.
  5abd27ec5e4fdabe1b9299681eb7271befdf4c17 /
  af48e9b95cccbd8bcc13b2ea8ba077cdfce215d4).

* [MAJOR ABI BREAKING CHANGE] Add Eigen::Ref support: now RobOptim functions
  accept blocks/segments of Eigen matrices as input.
* Lots of new functions (cos, sin, etc.), operators (plus, minus, scalar, map
  etc.) and decorators (cached function etc.).
* Callback system (logger, callback multiplexer).
* Simple Matplotlib support for visualization.
* Function pools.
* Set argument names (useful for plotting).
* Improved CachedFunction with LRU cache.
* Automatic conversion of constraints/cost function types when creating
  problems.
* Faster forward-difference rule for finite differences.
* Removed exception specifiers (void function(...) throw()).
* Storage order was changed from Eigen's default (column-major) to row-major.
  The storage order is available in the GenericFunctionTraits (StorageOrder).
* Move metaprogramming magic to roboptim/core/detail/utility.hh.
* Merge roboptim/core/visualization/util.hh with roboptim/core/util.hh.

New in 2.0, 2013-04-09
