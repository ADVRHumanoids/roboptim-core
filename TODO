* Detect solvers headers and compile/test only available solvers.
** Detect Ipopt properly.
** Detect CFSQP properly, choose a linking policy (license problem?).

* Remove duplicated code for array copy in cfsqp.cc and ipopt.cc.

* Choose a consistant, scalable linking policy (one lib per solver?).

* Clean, fix filenames, prepare for distribution (header names, etc.).
